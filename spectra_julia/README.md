### Requirements
The AIKEF ''detector1*'' output taken from the subfolders ''particle_detector'' in https://github.com/harnold8/ion_spectra 

The y-axis denotes the ion energy in eV, whereas the color code is the particle number at a given location of the trajectory (x-axis). Prior to the plot, various changes to the C++ simulation code AIKEF (https://github.com/harnold8/aikef_code) were made.
